# VUTOOLS v2.0.0 - Big Update

Released: December 8, 2025

Hey everyone! This is a pretty big update with a ton of new stuff. Here's what's new.

## What's New

### Discord Bot Got Way Better
Added 30+ new commands to the Discord bot. Now you've got 41 total commands to mess around with:

**Moderation stuff** - ban, kick, mute, clear messages, slowmode, lock/unlock channels, and some wild ones like nuke and wipeout

**Server management** - announcements, custom embeds, polls, giveaways, role management, nicknames, avatars, server info

**Fun commands** - 8ball, coinflip, dice, memes, jokes, quotes, facts, roasts, compliments

**Utilities** - reminders, calculator, weather, translate, URL shortener, QR codes, timestamps

**Info** - ping, bot info, server list, help menu

All commands show up in Discord's autocomplete now, so you don't have to remember everything.

### 5 New Tools That Actually Work

**Group Scanner** - Scan Roblox groups to find ones you can claim. Checks up to 100 at once.

**Server Lookup** - Paste a Discord invite code and get all the server info. Member count, online users, features, etc.

**Asset Downloader** - Get info and download links for any Roblox asset. Just paste the asset ID.

**User ID Lookup** - Enter a Discord user ID and see when the account was created and how old it is.

**Game Tracker** - Track Roblox game stats in real-time. Updates every 10 seconds with current players, visits, and favorites.

## What Got Better

- Fixed the asset downloader showing wrong info
- Game tracker actually updates now
- Better error messages when something breaks
- All the new tools are marked with a 🆕 emoji so you can find them
- Kept the cyan theme consistent everywhere

## Installation

**New users:** Download the exe, run it, enter your key, done.

**Already have it:** The app will auto-update next time you open it. Just restart when it asks.

## Tips

- Type `/help` in Discord to see all bot commands
- For Game Tracker, use Place IDs from game URLs
- Try asset ID 607702162 to test the Asset Downloader
- Group Scanner works best starting from ID 1000000
- Server Lookup works with any Discord invite code

## Known Issues

None right now. Everything's been tested and works.

## Coming Eventually

Might add weather API, translation, memes, and more commands later. We'll see.

That's it. Enjoy the update!
